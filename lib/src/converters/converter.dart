/// nyxx_commands provides a set of converters for common argument types, a list of which can be
/// found below. These converters are automatically added to [CommandsPlugin] instances and do not
/// need to be added manually.
///
/// The list of default converters is as follows:
/// - [stringConverter], which converts [String]s;
/// - [intConverter], which converts [int]s;
/// - [doubleConverter], which converts [double]s;
/// - [boolConverter], which converts [bool]s;
/// - [snowflakeConverter], which converts [Snowflake]s;
/// - [memberConverter], which converts [Member]s;
/// - [userConverter], which converts [User]s;
/// - [guildChannelConverter], which converts [GuildChannel]s;
/// - [textGuildChannelConverter], which converts [GuildTextChannel]s;
/// - [voiceGuildChannelConverter], which converts [GuildVoiceChannel]s;
/// - [stageVoiceChannelConverter], which converts [GuildStageChannel]s;
/// - [roleConverter], which converts [Role]s;
/// - [mentionableConverter], which converts [CommandOptionMentionable]s;
/// - [attachmentConverter], which converts [Attachment]s.
///
/// You can override these default implementations with your own by calling
/// [CommandsPlugin.addConverter] with your own converter for one of the types mentioned above.
///
/// You might also be interested in:
/// - [CommandsPlugin.addConverter], for adding your own converters to your bot;
/// - [FallbackConverter], for successively trying converters until one succeeds;
/// - [CombineConverter], for piping the output of one converter into another;
/// - [SimpleConverter], for creating simple converters.
